🚀 Project Overview

NPM AutoCode AI is a Python desktop application that allows users to automatically generate and execute Python code using AI. It integrates NPMAI, a custom LLM ecosystem, to understand natural language task descriptions and return clean, ready-to-run Python scripts.

This project demonstrates agentic AI automation, seamless integration of LLMs, and GUI-based Python automation for end-users.

🧠 Features

Natural Language Code Generation: Describe your task in plain English and let AI generate Python code.

Safe Code Execution: Runs generated code in an isolated local environment.

Real-Time Logs: View step-by-step updates in the GUI while code is generated and executed.

Progress Feedback: Visual progress bar for task status.

Custom AI Backend: Uses npmai.Ollama to call your Render + Colab hosted LLMs — no local LLM setup required.

🛠️ Technical Details

Language: Python 3.12+

GUI Framework: PySide6

AI/LLM Integration: NPMAI ecosystem (Ollama wrapper)

Prompt Handling: LangChain Core (PromptTemplate, StrOutputParser)

Concurrency: QThread for non-blocking code generation & execution

Safe Execution: exec in isolated local namespace with real-time logs
